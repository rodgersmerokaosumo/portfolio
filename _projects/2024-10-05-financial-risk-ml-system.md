## Model Development & Performance

### Credit Risk Scoring Model
```python
class CreditRiskEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'xgboost': XGBClassifier(n_estimators=1000),
            'neural_net': MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(256, 128)),
            'random_forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500)
        }
        self.meta_learner = LogisticRegression()
    
    def predict_risk_score(self, customer_features):
        """Ensemble prediction for credit risk assessment"""
        base_predictions = []
        
        for model_name, model in self.models.items():
            pred = model.predict_proba(customer_features)[:, 1]
            base_predictions.append(pred)
        
        stacked_features = np.column_stack(base_predictions)
        final_score = self.meta_learner.predict_proba(stacked_features)[:, 1]
        
        return final_score
```

### Scalability Architecture
```python
@app.post("/assess_risk")
async def assess_credit_risk(customer_data: CustomerProfile):
    """High-performance API endpoint for risk assessment"""
    
    # Feature preprocessing
    features = await preprocess_features(customer_data)
    
    # Model inference
    risk_score = risk_model.predict(features)
    
    # Generate explanation
    explanation = explainer.explain_prediction(features)
    
    return {
        "risk_score": float(risk_score),
        "risk_category": categorize_risk(risk_score),
        "explanation": explanation,
