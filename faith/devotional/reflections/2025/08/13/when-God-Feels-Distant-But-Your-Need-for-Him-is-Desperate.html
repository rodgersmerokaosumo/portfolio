      <p><em>“The Lord is good, a strength and stronghold in the day of trouble; He knows [He recognizes, has regard for, and cares for] those who take refuge and trust in Him.”</em> - Nahum 1:7 (AMP)</p>

<p>I never expected to find comfort in a book about divine judgment, but that’s exactly where God met me this week. Nahum—a prophet whose name ironically means “comfort”—spent most of his brief book prophesying doom against Nineveh. Not exactly devotional material, right?</p>

<p>But tucked into chapter 1, verse 7, is a line that stopped me in my tracks: <em>“The Lord is good, a strength and stronghold in the day of trouble; He knows those who take refuge and trust in Him.”</em></p>

<p>Maybe it hit me because I’m in one of those seasons where “taking refuge” feels less like a spiritual discipline and more like a desperate necessity.</p>

<h2 id="the-weight-of-watching">The Weight of Watching</h2>

<p>You know that particular helplessness that comes with watching someone you love fight a battle you can’t fight for them? When treatments aren’t working as fast as everyone hoped, when the person suffering somehow maintains more hope than you do, when you find yourself questioning everything you thought you knew about God’s goodness?</p>

<p>That’s where I’ve been living lately.</p>

<p>And in that space, I’ve discovered something uncomfortable about myself: when stress increases, my worst patterns get worse. The habits I thought I had under control resurface with a vengeance. The spiritual disciplines that usually anchor me feel like one more thing I’m failing at.</p>

<p>It’s in this context that Nahum 1:7 became less of a nice verse and more of a lifeline.</p>

<h2 id="the-god-who-knows">The God Who Knows</h2>

<p>The word “knows” in this verse is <em>yada</em> in Hebrew—the same word used to describe the most intimate human relationships. It’s not God knowing about your situation; it’s God knowing you in your situation.</p>

<p>He knows the 3 AM fears that you don’t voice during the day.
He knows how your own struggles feel magnified when someone you love is suffering.
He knows the guilt that whispers, “You should be stronger than this.”
He knows the questions about fairness that you’re afraid to say out loud.</p>

<p>This knowledge isn’t clinical or detached. It’s the knowledge of someone who sees injustice and cares deeply about it. The same God who promises to judge evil also sees when good people suffer unfairly, and it matters to Him.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-context">Understanding the Context</h2>

<p>Nahum wasn’t writing from a place of comfort. His message was delivered to people living under the shadow of one of history’s most brutal empires. The Assyrians had conquered, terrorized, and scattered nations. For God’s people, every day brought the possibility of devastating news.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Maybe your “Assyria” doesn’t carry spears and siege weapons. Maybe it’s a medical diagnosis that refuses to respond to treatment. Maybe it’s watching someone you love suffer while you feel helpless. Maybe it’s personal struggles that seem to intensify just when you need strength most.</p>

<p>Right in the middle of describing God’s power to judge evil—earthquakes, dried seas, quaking mountains—Nahum pauses. Verse 7 reads like a gentle hand on a worried shoulder: “But for you who trust in Me, I’m not your enemy. I’m your refuge.”</p>

<h2 id="taking-refuge-vs-taking-control">Taking Refuge vs. Taking Control</h2>

<p>Here’s what I’m learning about taking refuge: it’s not the same as taking control.</p>

<p>Taking control is what I do when I stay up all night researching treatment options online. It’s when I try to manage other people’s emotions along with my own. It’s when I exhaust myself trying to fix things that are beyond my ability to fix.</p>

<p>Taking refuge is different. It’s active trust rather than active management. It’s bringing my specific fears to God instead of carrying them in isolation. It’s admitting that some battles are too big for me to fight alone.</p>

<p>The verse doesn’t promise that those who take refuge will have easy lives. It promises that they’ll have a stronghold—a safe place to run when life becomes overwhelming.</p>

<h3 id="what-taking-refuge-looks-like">What Taking Refuge Looks Like</h3>

<p>Taking refuge isn’t passive resignation—it’s active trust. It means:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bringing honest fears to God</strong>: “I’m terrified the treatment isn’t working fast enough”</li>
  <li><strong>Admitting struggles without shame</strong>: “I’m dealing with habits I can’t seem to break”</li>
  <li><strong>Letting Him carry what we can’t control</strong>: Treatment outcomes, other people’s responses, circumstances beyond our influence</li>
  <li><strong>Accepting that faith can coexist with fear</strong>: Trust isn’t the absence of fear—it’s running to God with our fear</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fairness-question">The Fairness Question</h2>

<p>If I’m being honest, part of my struggle has been with the fairness of it all. Some people seem to catch every break, while others face trial after trial. Why do those who’ve already suffered more than their share have to face even more?</p>

<p>Nahum’s context helps here. He was writing to people living under brutal oppression, people who had every reason to question God’s justice. But right after describing God’s power to shake mountains and dry up seas, Nahum makes this declaration: “The Lord is good.”</p>

<p>It’s not naive optimism. It’s truth spoken into the teeth of a storm.</p>

<p>God’s goodness doesn’t mean life will be fair by our standards. It means that in the midst of what feels unfair, He remains fundamentally, unchangeably good. And that goodness is specifically directed toward those who run to Him for refuge.</p>

<h3 id="the-beautiful-paradox">The Beautiful Paradox</h3>

<p>The same God who is powerful enough to make mountains quake is gentle enough to know your individual heart. The God who judges nations is the same God who notices when you’re struggling and invites you to find safety in Him.</p>

<p>It’s like a mighty king who could command armies, but when his child runs to him scared, he opens his arms and says, “Come here, I’ve got you.”</p>

<h2 id="when-prayer-feels-like-the-least-you-can-do">When Prayer Feels Like the Least You Can Do</h2>

<p>“All I can do is pray,” I found myself saying recently, and immediately felt the inadequacy of those words.</p>

<p>But then I realized what I was actually saying: I have access to the throne room of the God who spoke the universe into existence. The God who knows me intimately is the same God who has power over cancer cells, over destructive habits, over outcomes I can’t control.</p>

<p>Prayer isn’t the least I can do—it’s the most powerful thing anyone can do.</p>

<h2 id="the-invitation-that-changes-everything">The Invitation That Changes Everything</h2>

<p>Nahum 1:7 isn’t a promise that those who trust God will avoid trouble. It’s a promise that in trouble, they have a place to run. It’s an invitation to bring our overwhelming circumstances to the One who isn’t overwhelmed by them.</p>

<p>The God powerful enough to judge nations is gentle enough to notice when you’re struggling and to say, “Come here. I’ve got you.”</p>

<h3 id="questions-for-reflection">Questions for Reflection</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What is your “Assyria”—the overwhelming situation that feels too big to handle?</li>
  <li>How might it change your perspective to know that God’s intimate knowledge of you isn’t conditional on your circumstances being good or your faith being strong?</li>
  <li>What would it look like for you to “take refuge” in God today, rather than trying to manage everything in your own strength?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-those-in-the-storm">For Those in the Storm</h2>

<p>If you’re reading this from the middle of your own overwhelming circumstances, know this: your struggles don’t disqualify you from God’s intimate care—they’re exactly why you need His refuge.</p>

<p>God’s knowledge of you includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every hardship you’ve endured</li>
  <li>Every tear you’ve cried that others never saw</li>
  <li>The weariness in your body and soul</li>
  <li>Your hope that still burns despite slow progress</li>
  <li>Your fear for those you love</li>
</ul>

<p>And that same intimate knowledge comes with an invitation: “Come to Me. I am your stronghold.”</p>

<p>Today, whatever your “day of trouble” looks like, that invitation stands. He knows. He cares. He’s strong enough to be your stronghold.</p>

<p>And that’s enough.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>“He knows those who take refuge and trust in Him.” Today, that includes you.</em></p>
